<h3>Generalities</h3>
<p>To begin with, it is important to clarify the objectives and target audience of this project. The project <b>'Expediente Docente'</b> was specifically developed for the Education Department at <a href="https://www.uca.edu.ni/">Universidad Centroamericana</a> de Nicaragua as part of the mid-practice program in <b>System Engineering career.</b></p>
<p><b>'Expediente Docente'</b> serves as an internal social network within the <a href="http://blog.uca.edu.ni/departamentoeducacion/">Education Department</a>, but with a distinct purpose. Its primary objective is to effectively manage the academic and professional lives of the department's teachers, while also providing valuable feedback to enhance their teaching practices.</p>

<h3>Project Vision</h3>
<p>Although it was necessary to meet the <b>stakeholder's</b> objectives in terms of required functionalities, I personally had a different vision . I considered the interfaces and user experience of the university's web services to be outdated, unfriendly and simple.</p>
<p>One of the limitations I identified was the use of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> in the project and requirements, as it greatly restricted the visual freedoms of the application. By consensus with my development team, we decided not to use this graphical framework and create the styles from zero. The visual result was considerably better than if we had used Bootstrap.</p>
<p>The objective I set for the application was to surpass any existing platform within the university and in my country. This is not an unrealistic goal to imagine since the majority of universities do not have a similar system, and if they do, they rely on an external CMS or LMS.</p>
<p>I believe that the development results were satisfactory for both the stakeholder and the development team. We managed to achieve the set objectives and, at the same time, significantly improved the visual and user experience compared to other existing platforms.</p>

<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>I had a position in the project for create bases, features and styles for it. Besides, i fixed the structures and several minimal things.</p>
