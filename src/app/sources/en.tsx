      description: `Hello! I'm David Quintanilla Ruiz, a programmer who also dabbles in the world of design. I consider myself a fast learner, easily adaptable to the current needs. I possess excellent communication skills and know how to lead teams effectively. My expertise lies in creating and designing web pages, particularly focusing on user interface and user experience.
      I served as a Project Manager for the development of the 'Teacher's Record' platform at the Central American University in my country, Nicaragua.
      Currently, I'm a student of Systems Engineering at the Central American University of Nicaragua, expecting to complete my studies by 2026. Among my interests are playing video games, watching technology videos, and occasionally drawing.`,
